# Balancing Robot

## Overview

This project aims to develop a self-balancing robot capable of maintaining its upright position autonomously. The robot utilizes sensors and control algorithms to achieve balance on two wheels.

## Features

- **Self-Balancing Mechanism**: Employs real-time feedback from sensors to adjust motor outputs and maintain balance.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized using PlatformIO for streamlined development and deployment.

## Repository Structure

- `include/`: Header files defining interfaces and constants.
- `src/`: Main source code, including control algorithms and sensor integration.
- `platformio.ini`: Configuration file for PlatformIO.

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tiago-Ferreira-Git/balancing_robot.git
   cd balancing_robot


## To do
